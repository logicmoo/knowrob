% duration of a time interval.
% during/2 is defined as an operator such that
% queries can be written as `Statement during Interval`.
% The Interval is represented as 2-element list `[Since,Until]`
% where Since and Until are the interval boundaries (unix timestamp, double).
% Note that it is currently not allowed to call this predicate
% with one of the boundaries grounded and the other not.
% Either both boundaries must be ground or both variables.
% If used in *project* expressions, during/2 will scope all
% assertions in Statement with the interval provided.
